A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

//Create a Method
A method must be declared within a class.
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}

//Call a Method
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}                    // Outputs "I just got executed!"

//
