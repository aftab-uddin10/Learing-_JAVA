//Characters

//The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);

//Alternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);


//Strings

//The String data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:
String greeting = "Hello World";
System.out.println(greeting);
